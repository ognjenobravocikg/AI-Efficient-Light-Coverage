# AI-Efficient-Light-Coverage

Final Project for the Class Deep Learning.
Students: Ognjen Obradović, Petar Jović 3rd. 

Trying to solve the following problem: For a 2D room find a light source that covers the most surface. Implementing a deep learning approach, we are drastically reducing the computing time needed to find the optimal solution, instead of finding a target that is close enough while providing good performance.

Disclaimers:
This Project is just a proof of concept, therefore we will limit ourselves to creating and training on only very small images and a small number of light sources. You can change those hyperparameters as they suit your application or use.
